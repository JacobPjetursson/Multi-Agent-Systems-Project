1) How do we construct plans?

Proposed structure:

    Read file -> initial state -> planner -> list of subtasks (agent-to-box, box-to-goal) ->
    scheduler -> prioritized list of subtasks (heuristic) -> allocate tasks to agents -> greedy best-first for each agent on task ->
    return list of actions to scheduler -> print joint actions -> allocate tasks to agents and repeat
